#Overview 

Welcome to Twin Cities Engineeringâ€™s soil gas sensing project. Here, you will find documentation for both the hardware and software components of our newly developed soil gas sensing device. 

Soil health is a key part within the realm of agriculture and environmental sustainability. As such, understanding the composition of gases within soil void spaces is a powerful means to monitor soil health, offering crucial insights into nutrient content and microorganism activity. Unfortunately, existing commercial soil gas measurement devices are inhibitively expensive, limiting access for farmers and soil scientists alike. To bridge this gap, our team of student engineers is crafting an affordable DIY soil gas sensing device designed to measure carbon dioxide concentrations at three distinct soil depths every 2-3 hours. Our goal is to create a prototype that is not only economical but also portable and user-friendly, increasing accessibility to those wishing to measure and track soil health. 

Our prototype works by collecting gas samples from soil void spaces. This is accomplished with three soil probes of varying lengths (10cm, 20cm, and 50cm) positioned at each of the aforementioned depths. A pump and solenoid valves are used to collect gas samples sequentially from each depth, so they can be passed over a carbon dioxide sensor. A Mayfly microcontroller is used to control each of these functions and record the gas data collected from the sensor. This dynamic setup allows for precise monitoring and data collection, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution for soil health analysis. 

The development of the programming for this device was made possible through the utilization of resources provided by EnviroDIY's ModularSensors repository. The extensive collection of tutorials, libraries, and code documentation available in the ModularSensor repository allowed our team to streamline the programming process and ensure consistent functionality of the soil gas sensing prototype.
